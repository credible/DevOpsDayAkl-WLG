# DevOpsDay Akl & WLG

This repo is a place to discuss, offer to contribute, and plan for a DevOpsDay conference in AKL and WLG.

I have been so encouraged with the interest and level of support for running a DevOps Day conference, that I've created this repo to help communicate, plan and hopefully produce a DevOps conference in both Auckland and Wellington.

I feel with the level of support and the geographical breakdown, we can run a conference in both cities. Out vision for the conference can be found in our [vision.md](Vision.md) document.

It is my hope that these DevOps Days will provide a tipping point for the community where like-minded people can get together and share their fu.

A really good source of info is the [DevOpsDay] (http://www.devopsdays.org/pages/organizing/) site itself. Check it out. There's lots to think about.

If you're interested in contributing, or just wanting to be kept in the loop, pleas review the [contrib.md](Contrib.md), then make a PR and add your name  to the list. The only rule for contributing is that you define the level to which you contribute, i.e. a Pull model.

Any questions just ping me.

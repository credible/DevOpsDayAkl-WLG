#DevOps Day Conf Vision

The Vision or purpose for running the conference is to engage and support the DevOps Community. It is my hope that the conf will provide a catalyst for people to learn, grow, celebrate, share and be challenged. It is hoped that the conference will connect a community of like minded people that will meet and foster this community well beyond the end of the conf. 

For me DevOps represents each individuals journey in impacting and changing behaviours. I beleive there is great reward in providing a forum where we can share these experinces.

Tooling and process can generate huge excitment. New ideas and how these can be applied to Ops, Sec, RelEng, Dev, Test, etc - that have a profund impact on the lives of people and the organisations they work for.

I'm also excited to hear of a culture of gratitude in the DevOps community. The DevOpsDay ethos reccomends having a not for profit org present during the conf as a 1st class citizen! Also ideas such as a food bank where people can donate food which can be given to a local organisation. I think this resonates with the DevOps people which is just super!

These are just a couple of ideas I have but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. I encourage contributions. Just send a PR.

If any of this resounds with you then please add your name and conact to the ReadMe at the root of this repo and send a PR.
